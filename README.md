# gridpost
This is a challenge given by OS Systems . I was tasked with creating a Grid Post System that has the features to create Edite and delete.

The project contained a form to input data and grid to navigate stored data:

1. Form has 4 fields:
a. image
b. category
c. title
d. description

2. Grid should have:
✔ actions to create, edit or delete records
✔ filter field to search records by title
